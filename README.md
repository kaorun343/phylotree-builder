# PhyloTree Builder

An interactive web application designed primarily for creating educational phylogenetic tree figures and teaching the concepts of phylogenetic relationships.

## üìö Purpose

PhyloTree Builder is specifically designed for **educational purposes** to help teach phylogenetic concepts and create illustrative tree diagrams. Perfect for:

- **Instructors** creating teaching materials
- **Students** learning about evolutionary relationships
- **Anyone** who needs to illustrate phylogenetic tree structures and concepts rather than present actual research data

While the tool can handle real data, its strength lies in making it easy to create clear, customizable tree figures for educational content, presentations, and conceptual explanations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive Editing:** Click to select nodes and branches for real-time editing
- **Visual Customization:** Adjust branch lengths, colors, and widths
- **Tree Operations:** Add/remove nodes, move branches, and auto-collapse structures
- **Multiple Layouts:** Support for 4-directional tree orientations
- **Dual Modes:** Author mode for editing and Presentation mode for clean display
- **Export Options:** Save trees as SVG or PNG images

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Switch to **Author mode** to begin editing
2. Click on nodes or branches to select and edit them
3. Use Ctrl+Click on branches to add new leaf nodes
4. Adjust tree direction and visual settings as needed
5. Switch to **Presentation mode** for clean viewing
